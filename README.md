Mentor-Web
==========

Static pages of a professionals connections website


This class project was a website for professionals to connect with each other as mentors and mentees.  I developed the front-end 
pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery.  These pages were incorporated into a .NET framework for incorporation with the back-end
and for deployment, but I have not included those parts here.  

The static pages can be viewed at clarkstonehocker.github.io/Mentor-Web/index.html  Most of the functionality is there, but of
course there is no interaction with the back-end or data.
